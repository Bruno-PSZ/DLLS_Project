# DLLS Project

Project for the classes: Deep Learning in Life Sciences. Repository contains code needed to reproduce our results of baseline models and CellSighter.

## Baselines Models
There are two notebooks:
* `Baselines_train.ipynb` -> It is a reproducible code to train our baseline models on the provided train data. Trained models are saved in the `models` directory. Please insert your train data in the directory `data`.
* `Baselines_evaluate.ipynb` -> It is a reproducible code to evaluate our baseline models on the test data. To download trained models go there: [Download Trained Baselines Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lDS-3logvzyqM4k6VhqF8HSPVbsfvCJD?usp=sharing). After download put it into the folder: `models`. Please check if you inserted test data in the directory `data`.
